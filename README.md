## 📚 Project Origins

**Game Foundation**: This project began with tutorial code from [CodingLab](https://youtu.be/RC7NbjwP3QA?si=JKdrxt4AuqHna5-q) which provided the initial game structure and basic functionality.

**Visual Inspiration**: 
- Rock/paper/scissors vector concepts were inspired by designs from [Vecteezy](https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/f9/01/ed/f901ed50bc0d7516d82665df6058e962.jpg)
- All images have been **completely redrawn from scratch** with personal modifications and custom styling
- No original Vecteezy assets were used - only as visual reference for inspiration
- Final color schemes, styling, and design implementations are original work

## 🎮 Features

- **Modern UI Design**: Clean interface with smooth animations and transitions
- **Responsive Layout**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of player and computer scores
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual indicators for selections and results
- **Game States**: Dynamic background changes during gameplay
- **Restart Functionality**: One-click game reset

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Choose your move**: Click on Rock, Paper, or Scissors
2. **Watch the animation**: The game will reveal both choices
3. **See the result**: Winner is determined based on classic rules:
   - Rock crushes Scissors

   - Paper covers Rock
4. **First to 3 wins**: Game ends when either player reaches 3 points
5. **Play again**: Click restart to begin a new game
